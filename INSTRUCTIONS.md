# Longest succession of 1's
Given an array of 0s and 1s, it finds the position of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get longest continuous sequence of 1s.


## Command line interface
The program must run from the command line with the following arguments
```
Longest <sequence_of_0_or_1>
```

## Example
```
$ Longest 1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
index 9

$ Longest 1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
index 4
```
